      "testimonial2": "Our guide was Ivan who has years of experience and could answer any question, he is like the walking lexicon of Uganda! He makes one feel like a VIP and friend at the same time. When we didn't get to see the chimps in the trekking, Ivan spoke to the Rangers and had us join an afternoon trip to enable us to get to see the chimps! Ivan is also a very skillful driver, we always felt super safe and comfortable.",
      "testimonial3": "Choosing Uganda as this year's travel destination was an excellent idea! I felt at home from the first minute and after four weeks, I left quite a number of very good friends. Starting from the organization, the careful selection of the lodges, the excellent guide and driver, Ivan, down to the daily little somethings. Simply perfect!"
