  "description": "Begin in the clean, green hills of Kigali — one of Africa's most livable capitals — and end ten days later at a lakeside camp in Uganda, carrying memories that will reshape how you see the natural world. This cross-border safari is built around a single, transformative experience: coming face to face with mountain gorillas. You'll trek them in Uganda's Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, with optional gorilla tracking in Rwanda's misty Volcanoes National Park — home of the legendary Dian Fossey. In between, you'll cross an ancient border on foot, spend a full day with the extraordinary Bakiga people, search for tree-climbing lions in Ishasha, glide down the Kazinga Channel as hippos yawn at your boat, trek chimpanzees through a jungle gorge, and farewell Uganda with a papyrus-canoe encounter with the prehistoric shoebill stork. Few trips pack this much into ten days. Fewer still do it across two countries.",

The gorillas may be 30 minutes away or three hours — the rangers know their territory intimately, and every step deepens the anticipation. When you find them, time stops. A silverback shifts in the undergrowth. An infant watches you from its mother's shoulder. A teenager charges playfully, then retreats.

In the afternoon you board a boat and glide into one of Uganda's finest wildlife experiences. Hippos groan and jostle at the waterline. Crocodiles eye your boat from the mud. Buffalo wade belly-deep to drink. And the birdlife is extraordinary: fish eagles, bee-eaters, kingfishers, pelicans, and herons line the banks in an avian pageant that has no equal in East Africa.",

Somewhere in the canopy above the gorge floor, a community of chimpanzees are starting their day. Finding them is the challenge, and your ranger-guide knows every trail. When you do find them, the noise announces them first: the hooting, screaming, and branch-crashing of primates very much at home.

Uganda visas cost $50 and must be applied for online before travel. Both countries participate in the East Africa Tourist Visa scheme, which allows a single $100 visa covering Rwanda, Uganda, and Kenya — often the most cost-effective option. We advise on the best option when you book."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the Rwanda gorilla permit included?",
      "answer": "The Uganda gorilla trekking permit ($800 per person) is included in the base price. Rwanda gorilla tracking on Day 3 is optional and costs $1,500 per person — we recommend it if your budget allows, as tracking gorillas in two different countries on the same trip is a rare and extraordinary experience. Please let us know at booking so we can secure the Rwanda permit in advance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Bakiga homestay experience like?",
      "answer": "The Bakiga homestay is a genuine cultural immersion, not a staged performance. You stay with a real Bakiga family in the Kabale highlands, eat the same food they eat (full board), participate in daily farming and craft activities, and spend the evening around the fire with traditional music and storytelling. Accommodation is simple but clean and comfortable. This day is consistently one of the most talked-about moments of the entire trip."
    },
    {
      "question": "How physically demanding is the gorilla trek?",
      "answer": "A moderate level of fitness is recommended. Treks can last 2–6 hours through hilly, sometimes muddy forest terrain. The pace is always set by the slowest member of the group, and porters are available at the trailhead to carry your bag and offer a steadying hand. We have seen guests of all ages and fitness levels complete the trek successfully. The adrenaline of finding the gorillas makes you forget any tiredness immediately."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the shoebill stork and why is it special?",
      "answer": "The shoebill is one of the world's most unusual and sought-after birds — a massive, slate-grey wading bird with a prehistoric-looking hooked bill the size of a wellington boot. It stands completely motionless for long periods in the reed beds, then strikes at fish with explosive speed. Mabamba Swamp on Lake Victoria is one of the most reliable places in Africa to find one. Seeing a shoebill on your final morning is the perfect, surreal farewell to Uganda."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can this safari be extended?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Popular additions include an extra night at Lake Bunyonyi for swimming and relaxation, chimpanzee trekking at Kibale Forest, a white rhino tracking visit at Ziwa Sanctuary, or Murchison Falls National Park for game drives and the Victoria Nile boat cruise. We can also extend into Kenya or Tanzania. Contact us and we'll design the perfect custom itinerary."
