This twelve-day journey is designed to do exactly that — to peel back the layers of this extraordinary country until you've seen the deepest jungle and the widest savannah, trekked gorillas and chimps, shared a meal with an ancient highland community, visited the original forest dwellers, and paddled a dugout canoe across a lake so beautiful it doesn't look real. From the zebras of Lake Mburo to the tree-climbing lions of Ishasha; from the Batwa pygmies of Kisoro to a silverback in full Bwindi glory — this is Uganda at its most spectacular. Two gorilla permits included. No corners cut. No moments missed.",

    {
      "question": "Why are two gorilla permits included in this safari?",
      "answer": "This itinerary includes two gorilla trekking experiences — one gorilla permit ($800) per person per trek. Having two permits gives you two separate experiences, potentially with different gorilla families on different days. It means that even if one trek is shorter, you still have a second opportunity to spend time with these extraordinary animals. Both permits are booked in advance by Penny Africa Safaris and should be secured at least 3–4 months ahead, particularly for the peak dry seasons."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who are the Batwa pygmies and what is the visit like?",
      "answer": "The Batwa are the original inhabitants of the forests of southwestern Uganda — hunter-gatherers whose ancestors lived inside what are now Bwindi and Mgahinga national parks for thousands of years before they were displaced when the parks were gazetted in the 1990s. A visit to their community near Kisoro is a meaningful, complex experience: they share traditional forest skills, knowledge of medicinal plants, fire-making, and their cultural history. We approach these visits with deep respect, and a portion of the entry fee goes directly to the community."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Lake Bunyonyi really safe to swim in?",
      "answer": "Yes — Lake Bunyonyi is one of very few lakes in Uganda that is genuinely free from hippopotami, crocodiles, and bilharzia (the waterborne parasite found in most African lakes). At 1,800 metres above sea level with cold, clear water, it is a wonderful place to swim freely. The free day at Bunyonyi is deliberately built into the itinerary as a rest and recharge day after the intense early days of the safari."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many wildlife species might we see on this safari?",
      "answer": "Queen Elizabeth National Park alone is home to around 100 mammal species and over 600 bird species — one of the highest bird counts of any national park in the world. Lake Mburo adds zebras, impalas, topis, and over 300 bird species. In total you should expect gorillas, chimpanzees, black-and-white colobus, red-tailed monkeys, olive baboons, lions, elephants, buffalo, hippos, crocodiles, and zebras — with leopard and giant forest hog possible."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between trekking gorillas at Bwindi and chimpanzees at Kyambura?",
      "answer": "They're very different experiences. Gorilla trekking in Bwindi involves hiking through ancient, dense rainforest to find a specific habituated family — each trek is unique, unpredictable, and profoundly moving. Chimpanzee trekking at Kyambura Gorge involves descending into a dramatic forest canyon that cuts through the QENP savannah, where a habituated chimp community lives. Chimps are much louder and more acrobatic than gorillas — the energy is completely different, and the gorge landscape itself is spectacular. Both are unmissable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can this itinerary be customised?",
      "answer": "Absolutely — this 12-day itinerary is a popular base that we regularly customise. Common additions include an extra night at Lake Bunyonyi, Kibale Forest chimpanzee trekking (the best in Uganda), a Mabamba swamp shoebill boat trip, or white rhino tracking at Ziwa Sanctuary. We can also reduce the duration for shorter trips. Contact us and we'll build the perfect trip around your interests and schedule."
