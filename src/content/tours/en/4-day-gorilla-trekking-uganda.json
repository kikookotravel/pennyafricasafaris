  "description": "There are fewer than 1,000 mountain gorillas left on Earth, and this four-day journey takes you face to face with them. You'll drive through the terraced hills of Uganda's Kigezi highlands — the 'Switzerland of Africa' — before plunging into Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, where an hour with a habituated gorilla family will leave you fundamentally changed. Finish with a serene afternoon at Lake Bunyonyi, Africa's second-deepest lake, where the adrenaline slowly gives way to quiet wonder.",

The landscape transforms dramatically as you ascend into the Kigezi highlands, known as the 'Switzerland of Africa': terraced hillsides cascade down into misty valleys, banana plantations cling to impossible gradients, and the air cools noticeably. By late afternoon you arrive at the edge of Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, where the dense canopy hums with unseen life and the gorillas sleep just a few kilometres away.",

After an early breakfast you gather at park headquarters, where your ranger-guides brief you on the gorilla family you'll visit and the etiquette of the encounter. Then you push into the forest — a cathedral of ancient trees and tangled vines, alive with the calls of birds and the rustle of unseen creatures. The trek can take anywhere from two to six hours depending on where the gorillas have wandered, and every step builds anticipation. When you finally find them — a silverback dozing in a shaft of light, an infant wrestling its mother, a teenager studying you with calm, knowing eyes — the world stops. You have one magical hour, and no photograph will fully capture it. Afterwards, transfer to Lake Bunyonyi for a well-earned sunset swim in its safe, bilharzia-free waters.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How fit do I need to be for gorilla trekking?",
      "answer": "A moderate level of fitness is recommended. Treks typically last 2–6 hours through hilly, sometimes muddy forest terrain. The pace is always set by the slowest member of the group, and porters are available at the trailhead to carry your bag and offer a steady hand on difficult sections. We have seen guests of all ages and fitness levels complete the trek successfully."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the gorilla permit really included?",
      "answer": "Yes — the $800 Uganda Wildlife Authority gorilla trekking permit is included in every Penny Africa Safaris gorilla package. We handle the booking in advance. Permits are limited (only 8 visitors per gorilla family per day), so we recommend booking at least 3–4 months ahead, especially for the peak dry seasons of June–September and December–February."
    },
    {
      "question": "How close will I get to the gorillas?",
      "answer": "The official minimum distance is 7 metres (about 23 feet), though gorillas regularly approach closer on their own terms — especially curious juveniles. You'll spend exactly one hour with the family. Flash photography is not permitted, but modern cameras handle the low forest light well."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Lake Bunyonyi safe for swimming?",
      "answer": "Yes — Lake Bunyonyi is one of the very few lakes in Uganda that is free from hippos, crocodiles, and bilharzia (a waterborne parasite found in many African lakes). Swimming is actively encouraged, and the cool, clear water is a wonderful reward after the gorilla trek."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can this tour be extended?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. This itinerary is a popular foundation that we regularly extend with a day of chimpanzee trekking at Kibale, an extra night at Lake Bunyonyi, or a game drive at Queen Elizabeth National Park. Contact us and we'll build the perfect trip around your schedule and budget."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I wear for the trek?",
      "answer": "Long-sleeved shirt and trousers (protection from nettles and insects), waterproof hiking boots with ankle support, a light rain jacket, and garden-style gloves. A hat and insect repellent are also recommended. Avoid bright colours — neutral greens and browns blend into the forest. We provide a full packing list on booking."
