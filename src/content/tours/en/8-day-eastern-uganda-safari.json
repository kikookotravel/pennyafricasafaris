  "description": "Uganda's eastern flank is its most exhilarating — a region of roaring rivers, thundering waterfalls, coffee-scented highland villages, and ancient wildlife spectacles. This eight-day adventure takes you from the source of the world's longest river at Jinja, up to the triple cascades of Sipi Falls for white-water rafting and cliff abseiling, then north to Murchison Falls where the entire Nile forces through a seven-metre gap. Add rare white rhino tracking and a canoe hunt for the prehistoric shoebill stork, and you have a safari unlike any other in East Africa.",

A boat trip takes you to the exact point where Lake Victoria's waters begin their 6,695-kilometre journey to the Mediterranean — a geographical fact that feels both vast and intimate when you are sitting on the water above it.

The afternoon shifts from land to water as you board a boat on the Victoria Nile, drifting upstream past banks lined with Nile crocodiles and enormous hippo pods.

    {
      "question": "Do I need experience for white-water rafting on the Nile?",
      "answer": "None at all. Professional guides provide a full safety briefing and all equipment — helmet, wetsuit and buoyancy aid — before you hit the water. The rapids range from Grade 3 to 5, and guides tailor the run to your comfort level. Tens of thousands of first-timers have rafted the Nile safely; if you can swim and are reasonably fit, you will be absolutely fine."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is abseiling at Sipi Falls safe for beginners?",
      "answer": "Yes. Sipi's operators use international-standard equipment and experienced local guides who control your descent throughout. You will receive thorough instruction before stepping over the edge. The guides manage the ropes — your job is to lean back, look out at the Karamoja valley, and enjoy it. Most people who arrive nervous leave wanting to go again."
    },
    {
      "question": "How reliable are shoebill sightings at Mabamba?",
      "answer": "Mabamba Wetland is the best place in Uganda — and one of the best in East Africa — to see the shoebill. While no wildlife sighting can be guaranteed, shoebills are present year-round and are regularly spotted by our guides, who know exactly which channels and reed beds to search. Most guests see one within an hour. Even on rare off-days, the swamp birding (herons, jacanas, kingfishers) is exceptional."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the drive to Murchison Falls like — is it very long?",
      "answer": "Day 5 involves around 7–8 hours of driving from Sipi to Murchison Falls. It is a long day, but we break it with a worthwhile lunch stop in Gulu town and the landscapes along the way are genuinely varied and absorbing. The rest of the itinerary is built around activities rather than transit, so this long day is the exception rather than the rule."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are gorilla permits included in this tour?",
      "answer": "No — this tour is built around eastern Uganda's distinct adventure highlights and does not include gorilla trekking. If you would like to combine these experiences with gorilla trekking, we'd recommend our 9-Day Budget Primate Safari or our 12-Day Spectacular Uganda Safari, both of which include gorilla permits."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can this tour be extended or customised?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. This itinerary is a popular foundation that we regularly combine with a gorilla trek in Bwindi, an extra day at Sipi, or a few nights in the national parks of western Uganda. Contact us and we'll build the perfect itinerary around your schedule, interests and budget."
