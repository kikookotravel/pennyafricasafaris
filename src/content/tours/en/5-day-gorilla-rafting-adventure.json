      "question": "Do I need rafting experience?",
      "answer": "No previous rafting experience is necessary! Professional guides provide comprehensive safety training and all equipment. The rapids are graded 3-5, offering thrilling excitement while maintaining safety standards. If you can swim and are reasonably fit, you'll be fine."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm not comfortable with Grade 5 rapids?",
      "answer": "You can choose the half-day option which covers Grade 3-4 rapids (less intense), or simply walk around the biggest Grade 5 rapid called 'The Bad Place.' Most people find the experience exhilarating rather than scary with the professional guides."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this tour too physically demanding?",
      "answer": "This is our most physically challenging tour. Day 2 involves several hours of rafting, and Day 4 requires hiking through steep, muddy forest terrain. You should be in good physical condition. However, the pace is adjusted to your ability, and porters can help during the gorilla trek."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can we do more rafting activities in Jinja?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Jinja offers bungee jumping, kayaking, tubing, quad biking, and horseback riding. Let us know if you'd like to add extra days or activities - we can customize the itinerary."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best time for this combination safari?",
      "answer": "Year-round is possible, but September-March offers the best rafting conditions with higher water levels. The dry seasons (June-September, December-February) are ideal for gorilla trekking. December-February offers the perfect combination of both."
