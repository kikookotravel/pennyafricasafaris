  "description": "This is Uganda without shortcuts. Fourteen days that take you from the thundering Nile in the north to the tranquil highlands of the south, from the Congo Basin's volcanic hot springs to ancient rainforest where mountain gorillas still roam free. You'll track white rhinos on foot, spend two nights in the remarkable Semuliki valley, trek chimpanzees through the jungle, find lions in trees at Ishasha, come face to face with a silverback in Bwindi, sleep in the mountains with the Bakiga people, paddle a canoe on Lake Bunyonyi, and walk at dawn through the acacia country of Lake Mburo. This tour also includes Uganda's great cultural dimension — the Bakiga homestay is a day that guests consistently describe as one of the most meaningful of their travels. Uganda is East Africa's best-kept secret. This is the itinerary that reveals it fully.",

You track them on foot with armed rangers through the sanctuary's bush, getting remarkably close to animals that can weigh over two tonnes. Then on to Murchison Falls National Park, where the late afternoon reveals the falls themselves: the entire Nile squeezing through a gap just seven metres wide before launching forty metres into the air in a permanent rainbow of spray.

      "question": "Is this itinerary right for first-time visitors to Uganda?",
      "answer": "This is one of our most comprehensive itineraries, and it is perfectly suited to first-time visitors who want to experience the full breadth of Uganda on a single trip. It covers Uganda's major attractions from north to south — Murchison Falls, Semuliki, Queen Elizabeth, Bwindi, the cultural highlands, and Lake Mburo — so you leave with a complete picture of the country. If you have limited time, our 9-day or 12-day safaris cover the southern highlights more efficiently."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes the Semuliki experience unique?",
      "answer": "Semuliki National Park is unlike anywhere else in Uganda. As the easternmost extension of the Congo Basin lowland rainforest, it is home to plant and animal species found nowhere else in East Africa. The Sempaya hot springs are extraordinary — literally boiling water bubbling up from the earth in the middle of dense forest. The bird list includes some of the rarest and most sought-after species in Africa. And unlike the more-visited parks, Semuliki feels genuinely wild and off the beaten path."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does chimpanzee trekking compare to gorilla trekking?",
      "answer": "They are wonderfully different experiences. Gorilla trekking is profound and intimate — gorillas are calm, and spending an hour in their presence is one of the most moving wildlife encounters possible. Chimpanzee trekking is energetic and often hilarious — chimps are loud, fast-moving, and extraordinarily expressive, making it feel like watching a very theatrical family drama in the tree canopy. Both involve guided treks through forest; both are unmissable. Having both on the same safari is one of this itinerary's great strengths."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the Bakiga homestay accommodate dietary requirements?",
      "answer": "Yes — the Bakiga homestay provides full board (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) and can accommodate most dietary requirements with advance notice. Traditional Bakiga food is largely plant-based: sweet potatoes, beans, matoke (green bananas), vegetables, and groundnut sauce. Meat is also available. Please let us know of any requirements at booking and we will communicate them to our Bakiga hosts."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the best time of year for this safari?",
      "answer": "This safari operates year-round, but the dry seasons (June–September and December–February) offer the best game viewing, easiest trekking conditions, and most reliable gorilla encounters. The wet seasons (March–May and October–November) see fewer visitors, lusher landscapes, and can offer exceptional birdwatching — many migratory species are present, and the forest feels extraordinarily alive. Gorilla trekking is possible year-round but muddy terrain in the rains can make treks more challenging."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can this itinerary be extended with Rwanda or Kenya?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. A popular extension adds 3–5 days in Rwanda for gorilla tracking in Volcanoes National Park and a visit to Kigali — making this a spectacular two-country safari. Kenya's Masai Mara is also within easy reach. Our 10-Day Rwanda-Uganda Safari is designed specifically as a cross-border extension option. Contact us and we'll design the perfect multi-country itinerary around your schedule and interests."
