  "description": "This nine-day safari proves that extraordinary doesn't have to mean expensive. In less than a fortnight you will track mountain gorillas through Bwindi's ancient rainforest, watch chimpanzees swing through Kyambura Gorge, scan fig trees for Ishasha's famous tree-climbing lions, cruise the hippo-thick Kazinga Channel, drift by canoe through Mabamba papyrus swamp in search of the prehistoric shoebill, and swim freely in Lake Bunyonyi's safe, island-scattered waters. Two gorilla permits are included — the biggest single cost in any Uganda safari — and every park, every boat cruise, and every canoe trip is covered. This is Uganda's greatest wildlife show at exceptional value.",

Your guide leads you along the gorge's rim before dropping into the forest itself, following sound and sign until you find the chimps in full mid-morning activity: charging between trees, cracking nuts on exposed roots, grooming each other with focused intensity, and occasionally stopping to stare at you with an unsettling, too-familiar intelligence. Chimpanzees share 98.7% of human DNA, and an hour with them makes that number feel very real.

After an early breakfast, ranger-guides brief your small group on gorilla etiquette before the forest closes around you — roots and vines underfoot, birdsong overhead, the air thick with the green scent of ancient trees. The trek can take two to six hours, and every step deepens the anticipation. When you find them — a silverback resting in a shaft of forest light, a mother nursing her infant, a juvenile studying you with calm, knowing eyes — the world goes very quiet. You are permitted a full, unhurried hour with the family, and no amount of anticipation prepares you for the reality of it.

Your armed ranger-guide leads you through acacia woodland and open grassland at a pace that allows you to notice what game drives miss: the ground orchids, the dung beetles, the tiny mongoose disappearing into a termite mound.

    {
      "question": "Why is this called a 'budget' safari — does that mean lower quality?",
      "answer": "Not at all. 'Budget' simply means we have optimised the itinerary to deliver maximum wildlife experiences at the best possible value. You stay in well-regarded local camps and guesthouses that are clean, comfortable and authentically Ugandan. The experiences themselves — gorilla trekking, chimp tracking, tree-climbing lions, the Kazinga Channel — are identical to those on premium tours costing twice as much. The difference is in the lodge thread count, not the wildlife."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are both gorilla permits really included?",
      "answer": "Yes — both gorilla trekking permits ($700 per person, $1,400 total for a group of two) are fully included in every price tier on this tour. We handle all permit bookings in advance. Gorilla permits are strictly limited to eight visitors per habituated family per day and sell out months ahead; we recommend booking at least 3–4 months before your travel date."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the tree-climbing lion experience like at Ishasha?",
      "answer": "Ishasha is one of only two places in the world where lions regularly climb trees — the other is in Tanzania's Lake Manyara. The exact reason is debated, but the prevailing theory is that the behaviour helps them escape the heat and biting flies at ground level. Sightings are not guaranteed (they are lions, after all), but Ishasha has consistently high success rates. If the lions are in the trees, it is genuinely one of the most unusual and photogenic wildlife moments in Africa."
    },
    {
      "question": "How safe is swimming at Lake Bunyonyi?",
      "answer": "Completely safe. Lake Bunyonyi is one of the very few lakes in Uganda — and indeed in equatorial Africa — that is free of crocodiles, hippos, and the bilharzia parasite. Swimming is actively encouraged, and the cool, clear water is a wonderful physical and psychological reward after the gorilla trekking day in Bwindi."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Lake Mburo worth visiting, or is it too small to be interesting?",
      "answer": "Lake Mburo is a gem that many visitors overlook precisely because it is small. It is the only national park in Uganda where you can do a walking safari — no vehicle needed — and it is extraordinarily rewarding for birding (over 300 species), with zebras, impalas, elands, topis and buffalo sharing the grasslands in a compact, intimate setting. It also has no elephants or lions, which is what makes the walking safari here safe and special."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the shoebill stork, and is it difficult to find?",
      "answer": "The shoebill is one of Africa's most extraordinary birds: prehistoric in appearance, around five feet tall, with a massive shoe-shaped bill and an unblinking stare. It is found in papyrus swamps in Central and East Africa, and Mabamba Swamp near Entebbe is one of the most reliable places to see one on the continent. Our local guide navigates the papyrus channels by dugout canoe and knows the shoebill's regular haunts — most guests see one within an hour of entering the swamp."
